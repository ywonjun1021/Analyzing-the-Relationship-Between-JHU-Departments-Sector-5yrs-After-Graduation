First converted the pdf data to Excel by using Tabula.
Find z scores by using formula =standardize for all %forprofit, %governemnt, %nonprofit, and %insufficient data

Then calculate distance squared by using =sumxmy2 for each each clusters
Then find min distance squared for all sectors by using =min
Then, I used the solver to find the sum of minimum squared distance.

Finally, get the cluster ids by using the formula =match
